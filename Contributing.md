# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions help to improve this project and many other projects on Github. If you would like to contribute it is greatly appreciated and more than welcome.

If you would like to contribute *please keep these guidelines in mind*

1. **Create a new branch for each issue** being worked on and be sure to *label it* appropriately
    - e.g. If Issue #10 is Missing option to filter data please use a name in the format IssueNumber-Description-MoreOfTheDescription
    > 10-Missing-option-Add-Filter

2. Maintain the _**indentation!**_
    - If you are modifying code, follow the indentation in place
    - If it is a new file, please open another file and use the same indentation

3. If you make changes, *comment your code*. Clear and concise comments make it easier for everybody to see what's going on at a glance
  ```  
  Function HelloWorld {
    Write-Output "Hello World! This is a powershell function" # outputs hello world to the console
 }
    HelloWorld
  ```

4. **Test your changes** - make sure that everything works and has been tested. If you add new changes please update Readme.md to reflect the changes!
> [Readme.md](https://github.com/aar318/New-Computer-Install/blob/main/README.md) 

5. Modify documentation or add new documentation where needed

6. When you push a commit be sure to comment on the changes made. This should be made in present tense to show what is actively changed for the applied commit

7. Once you are all set with the changes open a pull request. Once it is approved and merged you can pull the changes to your local repo and delete your extra branches
